# CSS Border - Shorthand Property

Like you saw in the previous page, there are many properties to consider when dealing with borders.

To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the individual border properties in one property.

The `border` property is a shorthand property for the following individual border properties:

1. `border-width`
2. `border-style` (required)
3. `border-color`

Example:
```CSS
p {
  border: 5px solid red;
}
```

### Left Border
```CSS
p {
  border-left: 6px solid red;
}
```
### Bottom Border
```CSS
p {
  border-bottom: 6px solid red;
}
```
