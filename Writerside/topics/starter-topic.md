# HTML
- HTML, a shorthand for Hyper Text Markup Language, is one of the most fundamental building blocks of the Web.
- HTML was officially born in **`1993`** and since then it evolved into its current state, moving from simple text documents to powering rich Web Applications.
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page
- HTML consists of a series of elements
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

## What is HTML5?
HTML5 is the newest version of HTML. The term refers to two things. One is the updated HTML language itself, which has new elements and attributes. The second is the larger set of technologies that work with this new version of HTML — like a new video format — and enable you to build more complex and powerful websites and apps.  

## HTML vs HTML5
HTML is the World Wide Web's core markup language. Originally designed to semantically describe scientific documents, it has since evolved to describe much more.

Most pages on the web today were built using HTML4. Although much improved since the first version of HTML written in 1993, HTML4 still had its limitations. It’s biggest was if web developers or designers wanted to add content or features to their site that weren’t supported in HTML. In that case, they would have to use non-standard proprietary technologies, like Adobe Flash, which required users to install browser plugins. Even then, some users wouldn’t be able to access that content or feature. Users on iPhones and iPads, for example, wouldn’t be able to since those devices don't support Flash.

Cue, HTML5. HTML5 was designed to cut out the need for those non-standard proprietary technologies. With this new version of HTML, you can create web applications that work offline, support high-definition video and animations, and know where you are geographically located.

To understand how HTML5 can do all that, let’s look at what’s new in this latest version of HTML.

### What is new in HTML5?
HTML5 was designed with major objectives, including:

Making code easier to read for users and screen readers
Reducing the overlap between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Promoting design responsiveness and consistency across browsers
Supporting multimedia without the need for Flash or other plugins
Each of these objectives informed the changes in this new version of HTML. Let’s focus on seven of those changes below.

### New Semantic Elements
HTML5 introduced several new semantically meaningful tags. These include `<section>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` `<nav>`, `<mark>`, `<figure>`, `<aside>` `<figcaption>`, `<data>`, `<time>`, `<output>`, `<progress>`, `<meter>` and `<main>`. These make it easier to write cleaner code that clearly delineates style from content, which is particularly important to users with assistive technologies like screen readers.
